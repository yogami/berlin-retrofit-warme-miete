# Warme Miete: GreenLease Optimizer - Hackathon Pitch Deck

This document outlines a 3-5 minute, high-impact pitch deck narrative based on the Warme Miete SaaS platform and the provided stakeholder ecosystem dynamics.

## Slide 1: Title Slide & The Hook
*   **Title:** Warme Miete
*   **Subtitle:** The GreenLease Optimizer resolving Berlin’s 1.2M apartment split-incentive dilemma.
*   **Visual:** Clean, dark-mode styling with your neon green logo. A powerful background image of a classic Berlin Altbau.
*   **Speaker Notes:** "Berlin has 1.2 million unrenovated apartments bleeding energy. We have the engineering tech to fix them, and the Government has the billions to fund it. Yet, nothing is happening. Why? Because of the Split-Incentive Dilemma. Landlords pay for the upgrade, but tenants get the energy savings."

## Slide 2: The Core Problem (The Split-Incentive)
*   **Headline:** The Deadlock
*   **Visual:** A simple graphic showing a brick wall between a Landlord holding a bill (€500k) and a Tenant holding a bag of money (Energy Savings).
*   **Key Bullets:**
    *   **Landlords** won't invest because ROI takes decades. They fear high compliance costs and CO2 penalties.
    *   **Tenants** fear rent hikes (*Modernisierungsumlage*) driving them into poverty.
*   **Speaker Notes:** "Today, landlords face crippling CO2 penalties if they don’t renovate, but they can't afford the €500k Capex. Tenants are already struggling with high heating costs, but fear that any renovation will just result in a massive rent hike that forces them out."

## Slide 3: The Solution
*   **Headline:** Warme Miete - The Financial OS for Retrofitting
*   **Visual:** Screenshot of the Dashboard main screen showing the "Warm Rent Impact" charts.
*   **Key Bullets:**
    *   **Data-Driven Consensus:** We instantly calculate the exact point where a rent increase equals the energy savings.
    *   **The "Warm Rent" Guarantee:** Multipliers ensure the tenant pays *less* total per month, while the landlord maximizes legal yield.
*   **Speaker Notes:** "Enter Warme Miete. We are a B2B SaaS platform that instantly computes the 'sweet spot' for every building. We mathematically prove to the tenant that their total 'Warm Rent' will decrease, while simultaneously proving to the landlord that their property yield will increase."

## Slide 4: LIVE DEMO (The "Aha!" Moment)
*   **Headline:** See It In Action
*   **Visual:** (Switch to live browser / Railway deployment URL)
*   **Actionable Flow:**
    1.  Show a 20-unit building stuck in 1970.
    2.  Click "Deep Retrofit".
    3.  Show the instant calculation: The €1M Capex is halved by a €500k subsidy we auto-identified.
    4.  Point to the *Warm Rent Impact* Chart: Show the tenant's exact net savings per year.
*   **Speaker Notes:** *(Walk through the UI)* "With three clicks, we take a 20-unit building from 1970 and simulate a Deep Retrofit. Watch what happens: The system instantly identifies €500k in KfW subsidies. Most importantly, look at the bottom graph. The tenant's base rent goes up, but their heating bill crashes. Their total Warm Rent is cheaper. The landlord gets higher yield and avoids CO2 taxes. Everyone wins."

## Slide 5: The Ecosystem Alignment (The Moat)
*   *(This is where you shine based on the PDF data provided)*
*   **Headline:** Orchestrating a €41bn Market Stimulus
*   **Visual:** A sleek node-graph or a clean grid (like the UI component) showing the stakeholders.
*   **Key Bullets:**
    *   **Tenants:** €1.2k+ lower heating bills / Warmer homes.
    *   **Landlords:** Higher yields / Avoid 95% CO2 tax.
    *   **Banks/Gov:** De-risked green loans / Hitting climate targets (EPBD/GEG).
*   **Speaker Notes:** "We don't just solve the tension between the landlord and tenant. We align the entire ecosystem. Property managers get a compliance tool. Banks get de-risked green loans backed by predictable savings. Energy consultants triple their output. We are the digital glue for a €41 billion market stimulus."

## Slide 6: Business Model (How we capture value)
*   **Headline:** B2B SaaS + Marketplace Fees
*   **Visual:** 3 Pricing Tiers (Freemium, Pro, Enterprise) or a simple flowchart.
*   **Key Bullets:**
    *   **SaaS Subscription:** €50-200/mo per building charged to Property Managers (Hausverwaltung).
    *   **Lead Generation (B2B):** Flat fees for funneling qualified, derisked projects to Contractors and Energy Consultants.
    *   **Loan Origination:** Potential 1-2% fee from Banks for sourcing verified "Green Loan" volume.
*   **Speaker Notes:** "How do we make money in this massive TAM? We are a B2B SaaS tool. Property managers pay a per-building subscription for compliance and WEG approvals. But the real upside is the marketplace: we aggregate demand and charge lead fees to energy consultants, contractors, and take origination fees from banks for delivering de-risked loan volume."

## Slide 7: Why Not Just "Better Engineering"?
*   *(Use this if addressing the 3D model/engineering question)*
*   **Headline:** Financial Innovation Precedes Technical Execution
*   **Visual:** Warme Miete (The Lock) 👉 Engineering Partners like Ecoworks (The Key)
*   **Key Bullets:**
    *   The bottleneck isn't technical capability; it's financial deadlock.
    *   We don't build 3D models; we partner with the best who do.
*   **Speaker Notes:** "You might ask, 'What about the engineering problems? Heat maps, 3D models?' Our answer is simple: We leave that to incredible partners like Ecoworks. The current bottleneck isn't knowing *how* to build; it's the financial gridlock. We unlock the budget so the engineering can actually happen."

## Slide 8: The Roadmap to Trust (Defensive Tech)
*   **Headline:** Building the Un-fakeable Compliance Engine
*   **Visual:** A 12-month timeline emphasizing security and institutional integration.
*   **Key Bullets:**
    *   **Now (MVP):** Fully working Prototype backed by Open-Source, mathematically bounded Acceptance Tests (ATDD).
    *   **Month 3:** "Zero-Trust" Data Sovereignty architecture. No tenant PII is ever stored, ensuring total GDPR immunity.
    *   **Month 6:** Cryptographic *Proof of Execution* (PoE) for all calculations, providing landlords immutable defense in tenant court.
    *   **Month 12:** Direct API integration with KfW/BAFA and legacy prop-tech software (Domus/DATEV) for one-click compliance.
*   **Speaker Notes:** "How do we get conservative property managers to trust our software? We don't ask them to. We are building 'Defensive Tech.' Our calculation engine is open-source for peer review. Our roadmap includes Cryptographic Proof-of-Execution so landlords have a mathematical defense against tenant lawsuits. We aren't building a calculator; we are building an immutable legal and financial audit trail."

## Slide 9: Closing Slide
*   **Visual:** Big bold logo. Live URL link. Your contact info.
*   **Text:** "Warme Miete: Because Saving the Planet should make Financial Sense."
*   **Speaker Notes:** "Thank you."

## Slide 10: AI Tools Used (Mandatory Disclosure)
*   **Headline:** AI Acceleration & Quality Assurance
*   **Visual:** Fast-paced split screen showing GitHub Copilot logo and an AI Chat interface.
*   **Key Bullets:**
    *   **Antigravity (Google Deepmind Engine):** Used aggressively during the 7-hour sprint for React component generation (UI/UX), Drizzle ORM database scaffolding, and writing the deterministic Playwright End-to-End test suites.
    *   **GitHub Copilot:** Used inline for syntax auto-completion and rapid error correction during the API integration phase.
    *   **Mathematical Domain Logic:** (Important) All core Domain-Driven Design math (ROI, Yield, Subsidy calculations) was explicitly coded with human oversight and bounded by mathematically verified Acceptance Tests (ATDD). 
*   **Speaker Notes:** *"In compliance with the hackathon rules, we want to transparently share our AI stack. We used advanced agentic models for boilerplate React generation and writing our automated test suites. This allowed us to focus 100% of our human cognitive load on the actual business problem: the complex financial math and the real-world stakeholder incentives."*
